# Real-eastate-agency-advertisements-app--v2
web application for the management of the advertisements of a real estate agency.


Project context
Based on the relational diagram of the database produced in the previous brief, we entrust you in this current brief with the implementation of a web application which will allow the management of advertisements.

The application must have the following interfaces:

​

"Home" page allows you to:

List all announcements in the form of cards. Each card contains the title, category, type, area, address, price and main image of that ad. The user will be able to consult the details of an ad by clicking on a card (details.php).
Perform searches using various filters (city, category, type, price)
Sort data by release date or price
​

Page "details" allows to:

View details of an ad with the image gallery
Contact the advertiser using a button that displays the advertiser's phone number
​

"Registration" page allows you to:

Create a customer account via a form:
Password entry must be confirmed
All fields must be validated (The password must be encrypted when inserting)
​

"Connection" page allows to:

Authenticate on the application:
If the authentication is correct: The customer is redirected to the home page and his profile remains visible at the level of the navigation bar in all the pages of the application
Otherwise: A personalized error message, depending on the type of error, appears on the same page
​

"Profile" page allows to:

View the list of ads with the possibility of editing or deleting them
Add a new ad
